Project description for the Booklet: 
The project aims to construct a water flow monitoring system by installing -inline - smart meters, which could...
•	Measure usage of each apartment independently.
•	Upload calculated data wirelessly. 
After collecting such enormous amount of data, an algorithm will be applied to forecast each district usage, enabling the water company to control the flow efficiently.
In addition, sensors will detect any leakage in the pipes automatically.
We offer a user friendly application to the company - to monitor such statistics and the forecast -, and to its customers - to monitor their water usage -.
